    <h2>Critical Reflection – Your proposed UI and UX</h2>

    <p>
      My website does have a specific theme and it is solely based on the color
      blue. I think that with my current website the user experience and user
      interface are considered basic and so are not very appealing to people.
      The website gets the job done by displaying the information that it must,
      and it can showcase all the information that I want it to, but I think
      that I need to put more effort into the design and overall enhance the
      website’s feel, look, and usability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lecture “3 Art, Graphics and Visualisation or Representation Again”
      we talk about art, how it is used, and if it is aesthetically pleasing and
      serves a purpose. The purpose of the art is to communicate meaning to the
      viewers a to help viewers visualize certain aspects of the websites. I
      think my website. My website fails to do this due to the theme and style
      being very abstract. The website itself does not communicate anything and
      so it is not good enough as the theme is just blue it does not allow for
      extensive innovation of the user’s experience and interface. I do not like
      the fact the whole website feels like a document in Microsoft word.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like the website to have a clearer signifier and signified as I
      want the meaning through the aesthetics and art to come through with the
      website. I want the website to feel better in terms of ergonomics and
      navigation Steve Gibson’s “Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology”
      (Gibson, 2004) inspired this thought as he talks about collaborative media
      and how this media can guide the user through using it and how the
      interface between human and machine should sync up ergonomically. This
      thought made me rethink the interactivity of my website and how the
      website feels and looks and if it has good enough usability for the users.
      I do not think so as when I was doing the peer engagement, I realise how
      much more effort and design went into their design and execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to make up for this I decided to redesign my website and give it a
      theme. I was thinking of two things the first being the ocean so that I
      could make the back group haves and the different pages of the website
      could be encased in a seashell and the second was more in line with
      computer code in general.
    </p>

    <h2>Sea Theme</h2>

    <p>
      My thought process for this theme is to make the background of the website
      look like the ocean and then to make the header and footer look like beach
      sand just before one enters the ocean. I thought of the because it fits
      with the theme of the beach and the sand can indicate both the start and
      end of a website. I would like to make shells that flip when the mouse
      hovers on them as this will allow for interactivity and it would look
      better for overall aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to enhance aesthetics and feel I wanted to add the sound of waves
      crashing and some more noises one would hear in the ocean. Another idea
      would be to add a randomizer that generates different objects into the
      ocean background as this could make the ocean feel more alive and look
      overall better.
    </p>

    <h2>Computer Code theme</h2>
    <p>
      This would look like the movie the Matrix (Wachowskis, 1999) with code
      running down everywhere as it has more to do with technology. Therefore,
      the theme would have the binary code running down in the background and
      the use of a lot of green similar to a retro monitor like in the Matrix
      (Wachowskis, 1999). This theme relies heavily on the film for ideas which
      I’m not too happy with I would like to add my touch so I’m less inclined
      to follow this theme to make the website.
    </p>

    <h2>Future theme</h2>

    <p>
      This theme is inspired by the previous themes as well as Steve Gibson’s
      “Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology” (Gibson, 2004). The idea
      for this theme is for the website to be cybernetics based so there would
      be a lot of like metal and shiny looks to go into the website. I could
      make the different pages look like holograms to add to the aesthetics and
      conventions of the theme. The color pallet would involve a lot of metallic
      colors such as grey and silver as well as the hologram color of blue to
      enhance the website themes and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like the idea since it matches up with the signifier and signified as
      well as the themes of the blog posts. This theme is very heavily based on
      technology and in this course, we talk a lot about technological
      conventions and uses since this theme is about technology it follows up
      that the theme can relate to what is talked about in the blog post.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      To conclude these are what future iterations I would like to make to alter
      my website to look and feel better. I think the addition of theme and
      athletics will change the website’s feel and usability a lot more and it
      would help the viewers keep interested and interact with things thereby
      enhancing the website’s overall feel, performance, and ability to relay
      information through blog posts.
